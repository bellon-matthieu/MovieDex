The film deals with arranged marriages, loyalty, relationships, making choices, trust, and finding true love.

It is the second live action theatrical film featuring Wonder Woman following her debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In Wonder Woman, the Amazon princess Diana sets out to stop World War I, believing the conflict was started by the longtime enemy of the Amazons, Ares, after American pilot and spy Steve Trevor crash-lands on their island Themyscira and informs her about it.",

The plot revolves around King Leonidas, who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian \"God-King\" Xerxes and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers.
